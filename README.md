## 📌 How to Run

To run any program:

```bash
python filename.py
```

(Replace `filename.py` with the file name you want to run.)

Make sure Python 3 is installed. You can get it here: [python.org](https://www.python.org/)

## 🚧 Work in Progress

This repo is constantly evolving as I continue learning. Future updates will include:

- File handling  
- Libraries (`import random`, `sys`, etc.)  
- Object-oriented programming  
- Week 3+ of CS50P
