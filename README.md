# 🐍 Python-Newbie

Welcome to my beginner Python repository!  
I'm currently learning Python through the [CS50P course](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/) and using this repo to track my progress, build small projects, and improve my coding skills.

Each program is written from scratch and includes input validation, basic logic, and helpful structure.
