📁 Python-Newbie — Week 0–2 Projects and Challenges
Welcome to my personal collection of beginner-friendly Python programs developed during Weeks 0–2 of Harvard’s CS50P course and ChatGPT-generated practice challenges. These programs helped me understand and apply fundamental programming concepts through hands-on practice.

📦 Project List
🧑‍🏫 Week 0–2 CS50P Assignments
File Name	Description
vowel_counter.py	Counts the total number of vowels in a string.
vowel_breakdown.py	Returns a count of each vowel (a, e, i, o, u) individually.
unique_words.py	Extracts unique words from a sentence, ignoring case.
atm_simulator.py	Simulates a simple ATM: PIN verification, deposit, withdraw, balance check.

💻 Program Challenges (ChatGPT Practice Set)
File Name	Description
even_or_odd.py	Checks if a number is even or odd using a helper function.
greeting_by_hour.py	Returns “Good Morning / Afternoon / Evening” based on 24-hour time input.
string_formatter.py	Applies various formatting options like .lower(), .title(), and whitespace cleanup.
expression_calculator.py	Parses and evaluates basic math expressions like 3 + 2, 8 / 4, etc.
meal_time.py	Determines if it's breakfast, lunch, or dinner time based on input like 7:00 a.m.
unit_converter.py	Converts values between inches/cm and kg/pounds. Includes invalid input handling.
plate_validator.py	Validates vanity plate numbers based on length, character rules, and digits-only constraints.
vowel_checker_sentence.py	Detects whether a sentence contains vowels (and optionally where).
pin_protected_atm.py	PIN-protected version of the ATM that stores balance and enforces input constraints.

💡 Key Concepts Covered
✅ Conditionals (if, elif, else)

✅ Functions & arguments

✅ str methods (split(), join(), lower(), isdigit(), isalpha(), etc.)

✅ Lists & dictionaries

✅ Loops (for, while)

✅ Input validation

✅ String formatting

✅ Simulated state (e.g. balance in ATM)

🧠 How to Run
To run any Python file:

bash
Copy
Edit
python filename.py
Make sure you have Python 3 installed. You can install it from: python.org

🚧 Work in Progress
This is an active learning repo. I’ll be updating it with more challenges as I progress through CS50P and beyond. Stay tuned for:
